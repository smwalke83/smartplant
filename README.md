# smartplant
Self Watering Plant - This plant waters itself if the soil gets too dry! It also gathers environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure, dust concentration, air quality, and soil moisture) and sends it to the cloud to be interpereted on an adafruit.io dashboard.

You will see several folders in this repository. Here is a quick breakdown of everything.

Adobe Illustrator - This contains the file used to cut a piece of acryllic on the Epilog laser cutter. This was glued to the underside of the lid to allow access to the OLED screen but keep water out.

Code - This contains all the code used in this project. There is test code for most of the components as well as the final code for the SmartPlant.

Fritzing - This contains the fritzing files for the wiring schematic.

Notebook Drawings, Plans, Etc. - This contains scans of my notes and drawings throughout the project. Good luck with the handwriting.

Solidworks - This contains all of my 3D designs for the project. That includes the basin, pot, lid and component shelves.

Video, Cover Pic - This contains the demonstration video as well as a picture of the final product. [NOTE: VIDEO IS TOO LARGE TO PUSH TO GITHUB, MAY HAVE TO UPLOAD ANOTHER WAY? 3/6/2024]
